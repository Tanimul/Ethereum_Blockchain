Foldable devices provide an opportunity for innovative app development. Large and small screens on the same device offer complementary but distinct interactive experiences. This new form factor allows users to “stretch” the screen to a double size of a standard phone for better visualization, and also “reduce” the screen size to fit into your pocket as well. Most of the well-known manufacturers have released several foldable device models tailored to different preferences. Folding features such as tabletop posture and book posture enable imaginative layouts and unconventional user interfaces. Foldable devices provide users with a better and more immersive experience. The most vivid example of such a device is Samsung Galaxy Fold, now available for purchase. However, the technology is predicted to become more popular among manufacturers of smartphones and tablets.
In fact, according to Statista, 75,6 million foldable smartphone displays will be shipped in 2025.

So, it’s about time you learn some basics of building apps for foldable devices.
 
# How foldable impacts app development?
While the foldable technology seems exciting from the users’ point of view, there is no clear understanding of how it will impact mobile app development. The technology already has quite a notable impact on the industry, with a lot of companies exploring the new technology.
Let’s explore some of the changes and benefits that foldable devices bring to app development:

* **Extra screen estate –** the main idea behind foldable devices is to provide users with an immersive experience thanks to the availability of a large screen. The foldable technology turns two screens into a single and big one.

* **Small size –** today, users need to choose between a compact form factor and a big screen. With foldable devices, they get everything in one device. Foldable smartphones can provide double the screen of the traditional device.

* **New content types –** thanks to the availability of additional screens, creators will be able to release new forms of content that will take full use of the added screen size.

* **More features –** modern smartphones have a limited screen size that doesn’t allow them to fit all the needed features. With foldable devices, it will be possible to create multi-screen applications that will provide users with more features on a single screen.
 
Foldable tablets and smartphones will one day take over the world of such devices, and they will bring along a lot of opportunities.
 

## What Should You Consider for Developing Foldable Apps?
As per the recent news from the technological world, Samsung has released a foldable smartphone by the name Samsung Galaxy Z. This is just the beginning of the next revolution in the smartphone design era.

This gadget has turned the table for the app development industry and sent them challenging signals to think creatively. As per the reports of stone temple and webFX, the user’s bounce rate is high, and the conversion rate is low on mobile compared to desktop.

So it is evident that the user experience generated on a mobile app is not satisfactory even today when we don’t have a foldable smartphone in the market. So it becomes imperative that a mobile app has to be developed by paying so much attention.

As per Statcounter, 55.4% of the users use the internet on a mobile phone compared to 41.96% desktop users. As per the statistics on Statista, the number of mobile users is going to increase rapidly. Smartphone users spend nearly 60% of their mobile time on different apps like social media, music, media and games.

How to develop apps for foldable phones? Though it will become challenging to develop foldable phones, the following factors will guide developers for smooth development.

## Challenges of building apps for foldables

Before diving into developing an app for foldable smartphones, make sure you know the challenges that will stand in your way. Consider the following factors to build a high-quality and user-friendly foldable application:

* **Superior quality -** No one is saying that the development of apps for foldable devices is a walk in the park. You will need to keep in mind that foldable phones must provide multiple orientations and have a different aspect ratio from traditional smartphones.
However, user expectations remain the same. They want to have a glitch-free experience when using your app. Thus, you need to know how to develop apps for foldable smartphones. otherwise, your app is doomed.
More testing - Foldable solutions provide different use cases and scenarios. To make sure that there won’t be any bugs hiding in the background, you will need to test every feature and possible usage scenario. It will result in more hours and costs spent on QA and testing the multi-window app.
 
* **Higher development time and cost -** If you decide to build an app for a foldable device or make an existing one compatible, you will be taking your solution into a new space. You will need to design, develop and test your app for a number of modes and multiple use cases. And with more work come higher expenses and time needed for development.

* **Tweaks & Changes -** After you launch your application to the market, you will need to make a number of changes based on received user feedback. This is especially important if you already have an app and want to make it compatible with foldable devices.
If you want to know how to overcome all of the mentioned challenges during foldable app development, continue reading the article to explore the best approaches that will allow you to do just that.



Foldable smartphones are a new invention in mobile technology. The development of foldable apps are an extension of developers’ activity with newness. Highlighted features of foldable phones are divergent from regular smartphones. Therefore, you need to classify how these features influence your app development method. Accordingly, you need to re-design or alter the development process. Taking necessary actions like maximum testing and receiving user feedback will lead to successful foldable apps in your account. Let’s create your App friendly for foldable phones.
